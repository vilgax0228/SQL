# Learning SQL: Generate, Manipulate, and Retrieve Data

**SQL** é a linguagem para gerar, manipular e recuperar dados de um banco de dados relacional.  
Uma das razões para a popularidade dos banco de dados relacionais é que, quando devidamente projetados, eles podem lidar com enormes quantidades de dados.

## Capítulo 1. A Little Background

### Introduction to Databases

A database is nothing more than a set of related information.

A telephone book, for example, is a database of the names, phone numbers, and addresses of all people living in a particular region. it suffers from the following:

* Finding a person’s telephone number can be timeconsuming;

* A telephone book is indexed only by last/first names, so finding the names of the people living at a particular address, while possible in theory, is not a practical use for this database;

* From the moment the telephone book is printed, the information becomes less and less accurate as people move into or out of a region, change their telephone numbers, or move to another location within the same region.

Because of the cumbersome nature of paper databases, some of the first computer applications developed were *database systems*, which are computerized data storage and retrieval mechanisms.

Because a database system stores data electronically rather than on paper, a database system is able to retrieve data more quickly, index data in multiple ways, and deliver up-to-the-minute information to its user community.
